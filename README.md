This is the repository containing all the code, plots, and images associated with my Math Extended Essay for my IB coursework. My extended essay investigates optimal compression techniques for medical images using discrete cosine transform (DCT) and singular value decomposition (SVD). Medical images often contain large file sizes, requiring substantial storage capacity and bandwidth for transmission. Effective compression facilitates more efficient storage and transfer while retaining critical diagnostic information. This research compares DCT and SVD compression across various medical image modalities to determine optimum parameters for high compression ratios with minimal loss of clinically relevant data. Potential applications include enabling transmission of medical images to rural areas with limited internet connectivity as well as reducing the data intensity demands for training machine and deep learning algorithms on medical datasets. Optimized medical image compression makes telemedicine and medical artificial intelligence solutions more accessible globally, improving healthcare accessibility and quality especially in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: Repository containing all the code, plots, and images associated with my Math Extended Essay for my IB coursework.

I hope to upload the PDF of the essay as well once I receive the results of my IB coursework.
